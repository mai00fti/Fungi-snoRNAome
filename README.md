# Fungi-snoRNAome
SnoStrip based annotation and analysis of fungi snoRNAs

# SUPPLEMENT
- Page is located here: http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/publications/supplements/17-001
- Supplement is (nearly) finished! --> proofreading!
- still missing (DONE):
  - box motifs as figures
  - boxplots of distances (sequence length, distances between boxes)
  - any secondary structure related figure?

# TODO
- prepare snoRNA family alignments for Rfam upload
- put tables about target switches in the supplement
- are H/ACA snoRNAs non-functional when they don't fold into a nice hairpin?

# MAKEFILE
- simply run 'make' to compile
