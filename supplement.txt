pictures in png and pdf?
tables as html and csv?

SUPPLEMENT:

2) METHODS AND MATERIAL

pics:
- Taxonomic trees for fungi + list of genome sources

tables:
- Table containing original snoRNA sequences ( 5 publications)
- mapping of original names with internal snoStrip names
  - table of C/D
  - table of H/ACA


3) RESULTS

sequences:
- fasta files containing box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs

alignments:
- (box and structure annotated) snoRNA family alignments

pics:
- pyhylogenetic heatmaps of snoRNAs
  - heatmap of C/D
  - heatmap of H/ACA
- absolute evolutionary events, mapped to the taxonomic tree
- relative gain/loss events
- evolutionary history of snoRNA clans CD_5 (including cluster evolution) and CD_19

tables:
- tables of snoRNA target interactions -> all tables from the appendix
